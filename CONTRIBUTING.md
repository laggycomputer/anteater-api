Thank you for your interest in contributing to Anteater API!

## ✅ Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- For Windows users: A [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) instance
- A Node.js environment
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), a blazingly fast package manager for Node.js
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#install--update-script), a version manager for Node.js
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for running the local database server
- Optionally: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) version 16, for generating database dumps

### 🧑‍💻 Setting Up

1. Clone the repository and change into it.

   ```shell
   $ git clone git@github.com:icssc/anteater-api.git
   $ cd anteater-api
   ```

2. Make a copy of the `.env.example`.

   ```shell
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Install the dependencies.

   ```shell
   $ pnpm i
   ```

4. Download the latest version of the database dump [here](https://anteater-api-dump.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/db.sql.gz), and move it into the `packages/db` directory.

   _Optional_: Verify the checksum of the database dump.

   To do this, download the checksum [here](https://anteater-api-dump.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/db.sql.gz.sha256sum), move it into the `packages/db` directory, then run the following command:

   ```shell
   $ sha256sum -c db.sql.gz.sha256sum
   ```

   If the checksum does not match, the database dump may be corrupt or have been tampered with. You should delete it immediately and try downloading it again.

5. Start the local Postgres database.

   ```shell
   $ docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. Start the development server.

   ```shell
   $ pnpm dev
   ```

   The process of database seeding (importing data from the database dump) can take a while. If at first this fails, wait a few minutes before trying again.
